Docker is a platform for developing, shipping,
and running applications in containers.
Containers are lightweight, standalone, and
executable packages that include everything
needed to run a piece of software, including
the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.
Docker provides a consistent environment
across different development, testing, and
production environments, making it easier to
deploy and scale applications.

Here are key concepts related to Docker:

1. Docker Image
   - An image is a lightweight, stand-alone,
   and executable package that includes
   the application and all its dependencies
   (such as libraries, binaries, and configuration files).
   - Images are used to create containers.
   They are often built from a set of instructions
   contained in a Dockerfile.

2. Dockerfile
   - A Dockerfile is a script that contains
   instructions for building a Docker image.
   It specifies the base image, sets up the
   environment, and defines how the application
   should be configured and run.

3. Container
   - A container is an instance of a Docker
   image. It encapsulates the application and
   its dependencies, ensuring consistency and
   reproducibility across different environments.
   - Containers run in isolated user spaces
   on the host operating system but share the same
   kernel. This makes them lightweight and
   efficient.

4. Docker Hub
   - Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry
   where Docker images can be stored, shared,
   and distributed. It serves as a centralized
   repository for Docker images.

5. Registry
   - A registry is a service that stores and
   manages Docker images.
   Docker Hub is a public registry, but
   organizations can set up private registries for internal use.

Using Docker, developers can package their
applications along with dependencies into containers,
and these containers can run consistently
on any system that supports Docker. This approach helps
to eliminate the "it works on my machine"
problem and streamlines the process of deploying and scaling applications.

The popularity of Docker has led to the widespread
adoption of containerization as a deployment
and packaging technology. Other container orchestration
tools, such as Kubernetes, can be used to manage
and scale applications composed of multiple containers.
Containerization has become a key technology
in the DevOps landscape, providing a standardized and
efficient way to package, distribute, and run applications.

Why containers?
- it's faster to deploying smaller units
- it uses fewer resources
- faster automation
- portability
- isolation from each other
